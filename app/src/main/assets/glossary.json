Each line or space indicates the pitch belonging to a note with a letter name: A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Moving vertically upwards, the letter names proceed alphabetically with the alternating lines and spaces, and represent ascending pitches. The A-G pattern repeats—the note above \"G\" is another \"A\". "

It is usually printed smaller to indicate that it is melodically and harmonically nonessential. When occurring by itself, a single grace note normally indicates the intention of an acciaccatura.

This number is typically a power of 2.\n2.The upper numeral indicates how many such beats constitute a bar.\nFor instance, 2/4 means two quarter-note (crotchet) beats per bar, while 3/8 means three eighth-note (quaver) beats per bar. The most common simple time signatures are 2/4, 3/4, and 4/4."

The upper numeral of compound time signatures is commonly 6, 9, or 12 (multiples of 3 in each beat). The lower number is most commonly an 8 (an eighth-note or quaver): as in 9/8 or 12/8."

      "name": "Mixed Time Signature",
      "definition": "While time signatures usually express a regular pattern of beat stresses continuing through a piece (or at least a section), sometimes composers place a different time signature at the beginning of each bar, resulting in music with an extremely irregular rhythmic feel. In this case, the time signatures are an aid to the performers and not necessarily an indication of meter. Examples of mixed time signatures are  5/8 & 3/8 or 6/8 & 3/4."
